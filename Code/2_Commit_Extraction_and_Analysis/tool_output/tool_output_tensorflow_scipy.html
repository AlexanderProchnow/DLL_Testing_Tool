<br><span style="color:green">+&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWith ``method="MM"``, the fit is computed by minimizing the L2 norm</span>
<br><span style="color:green">+&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspof the relative errors between the first *k* raw (about zero) data</span>
<br><span style="color:green">+&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspmoments and the corresponding distribution moments, where *k* is the</span>

<br><span style="color:green">+</span>
<br><span style="color:green">+&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspwhere the constant ``1e-8`` avoids division by zero in case of</span>

<br><span style="color:green">+&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspzero.</span>
